# antimove
Auto return to the last channel with a TeamSpeak3 lua plugin after being moved or kicked from a channel.

# Settings

The settings are included in the settings.lua file.

Whitelist of unique identifiers, comma separated list like with the default example, of people allowed to move you (so no move back to the last channel)

antimove_enabled stores if the script should be working by default when loaded (true by default, so, working)
